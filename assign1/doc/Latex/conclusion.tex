\section{Conclusion}
Our evaluation of three matrix multiplication algorithms, including two parallelized versions, highlights the critical role of memory management in program performance. This project has provided a deeper understanding of memory usage in programming, encompassing both parallel and sequential contexts.

Effective memory management and utilization significantly impact program runtime. In sequential programming, proper management can lead to substantial performance gains, while mismanagement can cause a steep decline. 
Beyond that, working within a parallel context yielded a surprising performance increase, which just goes to show how proper hardware knowledge and utilization goes a long way in performance optimization.
Designing programs with efficient memory usage in mind is crucial to prevent performance bottlenecks.
